# Automated Cookie Clicker Bot (Python + Selenium)

This project is an automated bot built using **Python and Selenium** that plays the Cookie Clicker game automatically.  
The bot clicks the cookie as fast as possible, purchases the most expensive affordable upgrades at regular intervals, and reports the final cookies per second after a fixed time.
